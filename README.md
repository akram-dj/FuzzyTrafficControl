## 🧠 Fuzzy Traffic Control System

---

## 📌 Project Description

**Fuzzy Traffic Control System** is an intelligent traffic light control and simulation system developed in **Python** using **Pygame** and **Fuzzy Logic**.

The project simulates a **four-way road intersection** where traffic signals are dynamically controlled based on the number of vehicles waiting in each direction.

Unlike traditional traffic light systems that rely on **fixed timing** or **round-robin scheduling**, this system uses **Fuzzy Logic** to:

- 📊 Analyze real-time traffic density in each direction  
- 🚥 Decide which road should receive the green signal next  
- ⏱ Adaptively calculate the optimal green light duration  

🎯 **Project Goal:**  
To reduce congestion, improve traffic flow, and demonstrate the application of **Artificial Intelligence** techniques in traffic management systems.

# FuzzyTrafficControl
🚦 Fuzzy Traffic Control System :
Project Description :
1/ Fuzzy Traffic Control System is an intelligent traffic light control and simulation system developed in Python using Pygame and Fuzzy Logic.
The project simulates a four-way road intersection where traffic signals are dynamically controlled based on the number of vehicles waiting in each direction.
Unlike traditional traffic light systems that rely on fixed timing or round-robin scheduling, this system uses Fuzzy Logic to:
Analyze real-time traffic density in each direction.
Decide which road should receive the green signal next.
Adaptively calculate the optimal green light duration.
The goal of the project is to reduce congestion, improve traffic flow, and demonstrate the application of Artificial Intelligence techniques in traffic management systems.
